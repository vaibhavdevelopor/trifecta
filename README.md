Welcome to the IETE Webpage Design Contest! In this competition, you will be provided with a basic HTML structure for a webpage. Your task is to bring this page to life by styling it creatively and innovatively based on the theme of a movie series of your choice. 

   Team Overview

Each team will receive a code file containing the fundamental HTML structure of a webpage. Your objective is to design and style this page according to one of the provided movie series themes. We encourage you to use any tech stack you're comfortable with—whether it's CSS, JavaScript, or any framework—to make your page stand out.

To spark your imagination, we have included a reference video showcasing a styled webpage. However, we urge you *not* to replicate the design shown in the video. Instead, use it as inspiration to create something uniquely yours. Select one movie series from the options below and let your creativity run wild!
